Here is simple TCP client and server. 

In the directories (tcp-client or tcp-server) you can simply "make all". It will work on most linux OS. 

You can enter message after run tcp client or you can enter the message as parameter (after every word, automatically space will be added). 

On the server side, you can see simple "select" structure used. 

client usage : 
./tcp-client [ip] [port] 
or 
./tcp-client [ip] [port] [message]

server usage :
./tcp-server [port]
